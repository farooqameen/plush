what do these normals mean

---

I'll interpret those 12 normal vectors in your coordinate convention (x = right, y = down, z = in) and explain what they likely indicate.

Checklist

- Map each unique normal to a direction in your coordinate system. — Done
- Count occurrences and infer mesh/face meaning (per-face/per-triangle normals). — Done
- Note assumptions and suggest next steps if you want to debug or visualize them. — Done

What the normals mean (concise):

- (0, 0, 1) — points into the screen (+z = in). Occurs 4 times. Surfaces with this normal face “into” the view.
- (-1, 0, 0) — points left (−x). Occurs 3 times. Surfaces face left.
- (1, 0, 0) — points right (+x). Occurs 1 time. Surface faces right.
- (0, 1, 0) — points down (+y = down). Occurs 4 times. Surfaces face downward.

Likely interpretation:

- These are axis-aligned normals (unit vectors along principal axes). That usually means flat faces (not smooth gradients) — i.e., face normals for flat-shaded geometry or repeated vertex normals for planar groups.
- There are 12 normals total — that matches a common triangle-based cube mesh representation (6 faces × 2 triangles = 12 triangles). Each triangle often has the same normal for its whole face, so you see repeats.
- However, a full cube would normally include normals for ±x, ±y, ±z. Your list lacks any −y and −z entries, and +x appears only once while −x appears three times, so either:
    - The mesh only includes a subset of faces (partial geometry), or
    - Normals are listed per-vertex/tris in an order that groups some faces differently, or
    - Some faces share the same normal but are duplicated/omitted due to winding or export choices.

Assumptions:

- Each vector is a normalized normal (length 1).
- Axis orientation is exactly as you stated (x right, y down, z in).

If you want to proceed:

- I can map each normal to the triangle/vertex index if you paste the vertex/triangle list or the file that produced these normals.
- Or I can create a quick visualization (2D/3D) showing which faces correspond to which normal so you can confirm missing directions. Which would you prefer?

## What the normals mean:

- **(0, 0, -1)** — points out of the screen (-z = out). Occurs 2 times. **Back face**.
- **(1, 0, 0)** — points right (+x). Occurs 2 times. **Right face**.
- **(0, 0, 1)** — points into the screen (+z = in). Occurs 2 times. **Front face**.
- **(-1, 0, 0)** — points left (-x). Occurs 2 times. **Left face**.
- **(0, -1, 0)** — points up (-y = up). Occurs 2 times. **Top face**.
- **(0, 1, 0)** — points down (+y = down). Occurs 2 times. **Bottom face**.

## Interpretation:
This is a **complete cube** with normals for all 6 faces:
- Front/Back faces (±z)
- Left/Right faces (±x) 
- Top/Bottom faces (±y)

Each face appears exactly twice, which is the standard pattern for a triangulated cube where each square face is split into 2 triangles. The 12 normals correspond to 12 triangles total (6 faces × 2 triangles per face).

## Key observations:
This represents a **complete, properly oriented cube** with all 6 faces present and each face having consistent outward-pointing normals. This looks like the output from a well-formed cube mesh where each triangle's normal points outward from the cube's center, which is correct for proper lighting and culling in 3D rendering.
